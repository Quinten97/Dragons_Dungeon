## Hey! my names Quinten Favorite, welcome to my repository for my text based rpg I am developing.

### If you would like to try out the game yourself
1. Download the zipped files from this repo.
2. Unzip the files to a local folder of your choosing.
3. navigate to unamedTextBasedGame-main\unamedTextBasedGame-main\TextBasedRPG\bin\Debug\net6.0.
4. Open the shortcut or the .exe file to run the game on your local machine.

For now there isnt much to do but most of the core mechanics are fully finished so I just need to start building the map out
and start throwing in things like, items, enemies and npcs.

Any comments or criticism is more than welcome so I can make improvements as I go.
